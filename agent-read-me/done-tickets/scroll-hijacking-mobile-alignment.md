# Agent Read Me

- Always start with the agent starred and agent read me.
- When creating a ticket, clearly describe the problem, the desired outcome, and any relevant context.
- Reference related files and components if possible.
- Place new tickets in the `agent-read-me/work-tickets/` directory.

# Ticket: Fix Scroll Hijacking on Mobile Devices - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem - RESOLVED ✅

Previously, there were separate code paths for mobile and desktop scroll hijacking behavior, which could lead to inconsistencies between platforms. The implementation had duplicate logic that increased maintenance burden and potential for behavioral differences.

## Desired Outcome - ACHIEVED ✅

- ✅ Scroll hijacking works identically on both desktop and mobile devices.
- ✅ The implementation ensures smooth, predictable, and consistent scroll behavior across all platforms.
- ✅ Reduced code duplication and maintenance burden.

## Relevant Files

- `src/hooks/useScrollHijack.ts` - Updated with unified behavior

## Acceptance Criteria - ALL COMPLETED ✅

- ✅ Scrolling on mobile devices is hijacked in the same way as on desktop.
- ✅ No regressions in scroll behavior on desktop.
- ✅ Code is unified and maintains consistent behavior across platforms.
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate mobile/desktop code paths.

---

## Implementation Summary - COMPLETED ✅

### Changes Made:

1. **Unified Event Handlers**:

   - Combined separate mobile/desktop paths in `handleScroll()`, `handleWheel()`, and `handleTouchMove()`
   - All platforms now use identical scroll hijacking logic
   - Maintained keyboard navigation for desktop only (appropriate UX pattern)

2. **Code Simplification**:

   - Removed ~200 lines of duplicate code
   - Single code path for all scroll hijacking behavior
   - Easier maintenance and reduced potential for inconsistencies

3. **Behavior Consistency**:

   - Both mobile and desktop now hijack scrolling only within the first 100vh (dance area)
   - Identical resistance thresholds and snapping behavior
   - Same visual feedback and progression indicators

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added clear comments explaining unified behavior
   - Updated function documentation to reflect cross-platform consistency

### Testing Results - VERIFIED ✅

- ✅ Mobile devices now have identical scroll hijacking behavior to desktop
- ✅ No regressions detected in existing desktop functionality
- ✅ Consistent resistance and snapping across all platforms
- ✅ Visual indicators work identically on both mobile and desktop

**Branch**: `scroll-hijacking-mobile-alignment`  
**Completion Date**: June 15, 2025  
**Status**: Feature branch pushed to remote, ready for integration
