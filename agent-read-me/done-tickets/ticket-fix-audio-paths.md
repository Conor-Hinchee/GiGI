### Title

Fix Audio File Paths to Resolve 404 Errors

- **[Issue]**: Audio files are not loading due to incorrect paths, resulting in 404 errors.

### Description

- **User Story**: As a user, I want to be able to play the audio tracks on the website, so that I can enjoy the full multimedia experience.
- **Problem Statement**: The audio files were recently moved to the `/public/audio/` directory, but the paths in the codebase (`src/components/DanceArea.tsx`) were not updated. This is causing 404 errors when the application tries to load these audio files.
- **Proposed Solution**: Update the hardcoded audio file paths in `src/components/DanceArea.tsx` to point to the correct location within the `/public/audio/` directory.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All audio file paths in `src/components/DanceArea.tsx` correctly point to the `/public/audio/` directory.
- [x] Audio files load and play correctly without any 404 errors.
- [x] The user can play all available audio tracks.

### Additional Notes

- **Context**: This issue arose after a recent refactor where public assets (images and audio) were moved into subdirectories (`/photos/` and `/audio/`) for better organization. The image paths were corrected in `ticket-replace-parallax-photos.md`, but audio paths were missed.
- **Dependencies**: None.
- **Related Tickets**: `ticket-replace-parallax-photos.md` (for asset reorganization context).

## Completion Summary

- Updated hardcoded audio file paths in `src/components/DanceArea.tsx` to point to the correct `/public/audio/` directory.
- Verified that audio files load and play correctly.
