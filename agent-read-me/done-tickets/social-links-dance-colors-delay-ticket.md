# Ticket: Update Social Links Dance Colors Animation Timing ✅ COMPLETED

## Context

The social links component features a color-changing animation ("dance colors"). Currently, the time between color changes is too short, causing the colors to switch too quickly. We want users to be able to appreciate each color for a longer period.

## Failure / Follow-up Issue ✅ RESOLVED

- ✅ There is an unwanted circular bloom/glow effect around the icon during dance mode (when the animation is active).
- ✅ Desired behavior: Only the icon should change colors and be centered. There should be no bloom, glow, or circular effect around the button or icon during dance mode.
- ✅ The visual should be clean: just the icon animating, no extra glowing or blooming background.

### Resolution of Bloom/Glow Issue:

**Removed Elements:**
1. **Pulsing background glow** - Removed the radial gradient background effect that created a circular bloom
2. **Particle effects** - Removed the animate-ping circular particle effects around the icon
3. **Drop shadow filters** - Removed the drop-shadow filters that were creating glow around the icon

**Result:** Now only the icon changes colors via hue-rotate animation, with no bloom, glow, or circular effects around it.

## Problem

- The delay/interval between color changes in the social links animation is too short.
- Users do not have enough time to enjoy each color before it switches to the next.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Increase the delay between color changes in the social links animation.
- ✅ The new delay should be noticeably longer, allowing users to view each color for an extended period.
- ✅ The animation should remain smooth and visually appealing.
- ✅ All existing functionality of the social links component must remain intact.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated SocialLinks.tsx component:**

   - Increased `social-icon-rave` animation duration from `2s` to `6s` (3x longer)
   - Increased `social-button-glow-pulse` animation duration from `2.5s` to `6s` (2.4x longer)

2. **Updated globals.css:**
   - Updated utility class `.social-button-glow` from `2.5s` to `6s`
   - Updated utility class `.social-icon-rave` from `3s` to `6s`

### Technical Notes:

- Animation uses `hue-rotate` filter to cycle through colors (0deg → 90deg → 180deg → 270deg → 0deg)
- Each color phase now lasts approximately 1.5 seconds instead of 0.5 seconds
- Random delay offsets preserved to create staggered animation across multiple social links
- All existing hover effects and responsive behavior maintained

### Testing:

- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ CSS animations properly updated
- ✅ Component functionality preserved
- ✅ Bloom/glow effects successfully removed
- ✅ Icons now animate colors cleanly without any circular glow effects
