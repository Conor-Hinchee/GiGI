# Ticket: Scroll Hijacking in Dance Mode - COMPLETED ✅

## Description

The Scroll Hijacking feature in Dance Mode has been updated to ensure consistent behavior across devices. Desktop behavior now aligns with mobile behavior.

## Requirements - COMPLETED ✅

1. ✅ Implement Scroll Hijacking in Dance Mode for desktop:
   - ✅ Ensure it behaves consistently with mobile.
   - ✅ Limit hijacking to the first 100 views (dance area only).
2. ✅ Hide the Dance Area during the Scroll Hijacking process.

## Implementation Steps - COMPLETED ✅

1. ✅ Reviewed the `useScrollHijack` hook in `src/hooks/useScrollHijack.ts`.
2. ✅ Updated the logic to enable Scroll Hijacking in Dance Mode on desktop.
3. ✅ Added conditions to limit hijacking to dance area only.
4. ✅ Aligned desktop behavior with mobile behavior.

## Changes Made

### Updated `useScrollHijack.ts`:
- **Scroll Event Handler**: Modified desktop behavior to only hijack scrolling within the first 100vh (dance area)
- **Wheel Event Handler**: Updated to apply resistance only in dance area, similar to mobile
- **Touch Event Handler**: Aligned desktop touch behavior with mobile behavior  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Limited to dance area transitions only
- **Consistent Behavior**: Desktop now matches mobile - scroll hijacking only occurs in the first 100vh

### Key Behavioral Changes:
- Desktop scroll hijacking now only activates within the dance area (first 100vh)
- When scrolling down in dance area, resistance is applied until threshold is met
- After threshold, user snaps out of dance area to normal scrolling
- When scrolling up from below dance area, user snaps back to dance area
- Normal scrolling behavior outside of dance area
- Removed complex multi-section hijacking that was desktop-specific

## Testing - COMPLETED ✅

- ✅ Verified that Scroll Hijacking stops after 100 views in Dance Mode on desktop.
- ✅ Confirmed consistent behavior between desktop and mobile.
- ✅ Ensured no regressions occur on mobile.
- ✅ Tested keyboard navigation within dance area.

## Result

Desktop scroll hijacking now works identically to mobile:
1. Scroll hijacking only occurs within the first 100vh (dance area)
2. Resistance is applied when trying to scroll out of dance area
3. After threshold is met, user snaps to normal scrolling
4. Clean separation between hijacked (dance area) and normal scrolling areas
