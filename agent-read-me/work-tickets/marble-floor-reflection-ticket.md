## Overview

Replace the firefly scene in the dance button scene with a grandiose cathedral-inspired marble floor reflection scene. The camera pans up from a polished marble floor, reflecting the Chinese character for dance (舞) as it appears overhead, surrounded by towering columns and arches.

## Steps

### 1. Make the Dance Floor 100% View Height & Remove Dance Button

- Refactor the dance area so it fills the entire viewport height (100vh).
- Remove the dance button from the scene.
- Validate that the dance area is now fullscreen and the button is gone.

### 2. Create the Polished Marble Floor

- Design and implement a polished marble floor at the bottom of the scene.
- Ensure the floor has a reflective surface for later use.
- Validate that the marble floor appears visually polished and covers the bottom of the viewport.

### 3. Add the Chinese Character 舞 and Its Reflection

- Render the character 舞 above the marble floor.
- Add a reflection of the character on the marble surface.
- Ensure the reflection is visually convincing (opacity, blur, etc.).

### 4. Add Cathedral Columns and Arches

- Add towering columns and arches to the scene to evoke a cathedral atmosphere.
- Use perspective and lighting to enhance the grandiose feel.

### 5. Camera Pan Animation

- Animate the camera to pan up from the marble floor, revealing the character and the cathedral architecture.
- Ensure the animation is smooth and dramatic.

### 6. Polish and Validate

- Refine visuals, lighting, and transitions.
- Test on multiple screen sizes.
- Gather feedback and iterate as needed.
