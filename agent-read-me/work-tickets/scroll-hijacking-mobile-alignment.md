# ‚≠ê Agent Starred

## Task

Create a new ticket to fix scroll hijacking on mobile devices so that it works exactly the same as it does on desktop.

# Agent Read Me

- Always start with the agent starred and agent read me.
- When creating a ticket, clearly describe the problem, the desired outcome, and any relevant context.
- Reference related files and components if possible.
- Place new tickets in the `agent-read-me/work-tickets/` directory.

# New Ticket: Fix Scroll Hijacking on Mobile Devices

## Problem

Currently, scroll hijacking behavior on mobile devices does not match the experience on desktop. This leads to inconsistent user experience and potentially unexpected scrolling behavior for mobile users.

## Desired Outcome

- Scroll hijacking should work identically on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The implementation should ensure smooth, predictable, and consistent scroll behavior across all platforms.

## Relevant Files

- `src/hooks/useScrollHijack.ts`
- Any components or hooks that interact with scroll events or scrolling logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scrolling on mobile devices is hijacked in the same way as on desktop.
- [ ] No regressions in scroll behavior on desktop.
- [ ] Code is tested and verified on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Next Steps

1. Investigate the current implementation in `useScrollHijack.ts`.
2. Identify differences in scroll handling between desktop and mobile.
3. Update the logic to unify the behavior.
4. Test thoroughly on both platforms.
