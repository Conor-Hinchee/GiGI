Welcome to the starting guide for agents! This document will help you determine whether the task involves **creating a ticket** or **actioning on an existing ticket**. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Step 1: Understand the Prompt

Carefully read the prompt provided. Identify whether the focus is on:

- **Creating a Ticket**: The prompt describes a new feature, enhancement, or issue that needs to be documented for future work.
- **Actioning on a Ticket**: The prompt refers to an existing ticket or task that requires implementation, debugging, or further action.

## Step 2: Decision Framework

Use the following questions to guide your decision:

### For Creating a Ticket

- Does the prompt describe a new user story, feature, or problem?
- Is there a need to document acceptance criteria, user stories, or context for future work?
- Are there placeholders or loose ideas that need to be formalized into a ticket?

If **yes**, proceed to create a ticket using the [User Experience Ticket Template](./README.md).

### For Actioning on a Ticket

- Does the prompt reference an existing ticket or task?
- Are there specific instructions or requirements to implement, debug, or complete?
- Is the focus on delivering a solution rather than documenting a new idea?

If **yes**, proceed to action on the ticket by following the provided instructions.
