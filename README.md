# GiGi D'agostino - A vibe coded website

Vibe coding is new trend in the web development where its claimed that anyone can create anything as long as the vibes are just rights. Vibing is easier when you are listening to GiGi D'agostino's music so this project is dedicated to him.

## Key Features

### Dance Area

The centerpiece of this project is the "Dance Area" – an interactive music visualizer a **Three.js Powered Fireflies scene**:The intensity, color, and movement of the fireflies are synchronized with the audio's bass, mid, and high frequencies.

### Dance Mode

When the music is played by the user, the page enters "Dance Mode". In this mode, the page transforms into a vibrant, animated experience. Text and elements on the page animate in sync with the music, creating a lively atmosphere.

### Audio Player

A random song is selected from 3 available songs, users can play or pause the music by interaction with the (舞) audio status indicator or the main play pause button in the dance area.

## Work Flow

Initially the project was vibe coded with github copilot in agent mode with prompts like "Create this feature" or "Add this functionality". Later, as the project neared completion, it was transitioned to a more structured workflow using the Agent Read Me system. This involved prompting AI agents to always reference the agent-read-me system to correctly parse the **intentions** of the request and either creating, working, or updating tickets.
