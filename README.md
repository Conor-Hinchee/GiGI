# GiGi - A vibe coded website

Vibe coding is new trend in softweare development where code is 100% written by Ai and the human just guides the vibes. Vibing is easier when you are listening to GiGi D'agostino's music so this project is dedicated to him, his music and the vibes.

## Vibe Coding Work Flow

Initially the work flow was only a direct promt like like "Create this feature" or "Add this functionality".

As the project grew in size and complexity, A more defined work flow was created to get a more consistent output from the LLM.

The workflow, itself made of vibes, generally splits prompts into *refining* requests and *actioning* on requests.

I proofread nothing, as this project is more about the vibes but I can see how refining these workflows can be a powerful tool as developers stop coding so much and start vibing more.'

### Dance Area

The centerpiece of this project is the "Dance Area" – an interactive music visualizer a **Three.js Powered Fireflies scene**:The intensity, color, and movement of the fireflies are synchronized with the audio's bass, mid, and high frequencies.

### Dance Mode

When the music is played by the user, the page enters "Dance Mode". In this mode, the page transforms into a vibrant, animated experience. Text and elements on the page animate in sync with the music, creating a lively atmosphere.

### Audio Player

A random song is selected from 3 available songs, users can play or pause the music by interaction with the (舞) audio status indicator or the main play pause button in the dance area.
